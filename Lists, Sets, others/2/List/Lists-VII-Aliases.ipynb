    "Everything in Python is an object.  Every object has an identity (id) which corresponds to the object's location in memory. The `id()` function can be used to retrieve the memory location of an object.  Variable names point to the memory location.   It is important to understand that two memory locations can contain the same values but are still two distinctly different  objects. Changing or removing the contents in one will not affect the other location.\n",

    "On the other hand, two different names can be used to point to the same memory location.  In this case, the variable names are said to be aliases of each other.\n",

    "When you have two aliases for a mutable object, changing the value of one variable means that the alias also changes.  So, it is good practice to avoid aliasing when working with mutable objects."
