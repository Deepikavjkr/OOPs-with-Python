    "The following guidelines should be followed and will be used to grade your homework: \n",
    "-  Write code as directed for the questions below.\n",
    "-  This is an individual homework assignment; no group submissions will be accepted. Any evidence of cheating will result in severe penalties being imposed.\n",
    "-  Sample runs shown in the question should be used as a guide for implementation. However extensive testing needs to be done on your code to deal with all test cases that might possibly be executed.\n",
