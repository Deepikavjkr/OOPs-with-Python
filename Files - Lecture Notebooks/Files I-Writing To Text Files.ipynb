In the code below, `f` is the name of the file handle. `out.txt` is the name of the file we are working with. The second  argument in the open function is the mode and is used to tell Python exactly what we plan to do with the file.  The value of `w` for mode indicates that we want to open this file for writing. Note that if the file exists and contains data, all that data will be wiped out and fresh data will be written into the file.  If the file does not already exist, a new file will be created and data will then be written into the file.\n",
