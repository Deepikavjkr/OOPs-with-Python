The Tour du Mont Blanc or TMB is one of the most popular long-distance walks in Europe. 
It circles the Mont Blanc massif, covering a distance of roughly 170 kilometres (110 mi) with 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) of ascent/descent and passes through parts of Switzerland, Italyand France.
It is considered one of the classic long-distance hiking trails. 
The circular route is normally walked in a counter-clockwise direction in 11 days. 
It is also the route of an annual mountain marathon in which the winner normally covers the entire distance in less than 24 hours. 
Usual start points are Les Houches in the Chamonix valley or Les Contamines in the Montjoie valley (in France), Courmayeur from the Italian side, and either Champex or a point near Martigny in Switzerland. 
The route passes through seven valleys around the Mont-Blanc massif, an anti-clockwise start in Chamonix would lead through the Chamonix (or Arve) valley, then Montjoie, Vallee des Glaciers, Italian Val Veni, Val Ferret, Swiss Val Ferret, and either the Arpette or Trient valley in Switzerland, dependent on the route chosen.
