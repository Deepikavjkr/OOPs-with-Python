    "   2.\tYou must also submit the data file (shipdata.dat)  with the records containing all data for the ships given in the test data file.  You must execute your program and enter data for all the ships listed in the test data file.  The resultant `shipdata.dat` will therefore contain all the data I have provided as test data.  This will enable the TA to more easily grade your homework.\n",

    "-  This is an individual homework assignment; no group submissions will be accepted. Any evidence of cheating will result in severe penalties being imposed.\n",
    "-  Sample runs shown in the question should be used as a guide for implementation. However extensive testing needs to be done on your code to deal with all test cases that might possibly be executed.\n",
    "-  The screen shots below show how your program should function with correct input.  Screenshots for handling incorrect input are not shown. However, your code should use exception handling to validate user input.\n",
    "-  Rename your .ipynb file by adding the first two letters of your firstname followed by the first two letters of your last name and submit the file as your response for this assignment.\n"
