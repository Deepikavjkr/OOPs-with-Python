    "\n",
    "In this notebook we cover another aspect of creating classes.  Oftentimes, a class can include an instance variable which \n",
    "is itself the object of another class.  This type of relationship between the two classes can be one of two kinds:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Composition:__ If the inner object is such that it cannot exist without the outer object, we use `composition` to include the inner object as an instance variable in the outer object. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Aggregation:__ If the inner object can exist outside the outer object, we use `aggregation` to include the inner object as an instance variable in the outer object. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will consider a simple example to demonstrate both composition and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an `Employee` class which includes, in addition to other instance variables, an instance variable which is an object of the `Department` class.  Henceforth we will refer to the `Department` object as an object of the inner class (or inner class object) while the `Employee` object will be referred to an object of the outer class (or outer class object).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first write the class definition of the inner class object.  Note that this class definition is a simple one and\n",
    "will be written like we did the previous example. We will then write two versions of the `Employee` class.  In one we use composition to include the `Department` object and in the other we will use aggregation. Finally, we will write a simple function to test out the `Employee` class by creating one `Employee` object and printing it out.\n"
