    "Inheritance helps to build a new class using an existing class, thereby promoting reuse and enabling `polymorphism`.\n",
    "Using inheritance, a new class (called the `child` class or the `sub` class) can be created by extending an old class\n",
    "(called the `base` class, the `parent` class or the `super` class).  The child class is a `specialization` of the base class and the base class is a `generalization` of the child class.  The `is-a` relationship is used to depict the relationship between a base class and a child class. In other words, we say that a child class object `is` (also) `a` base class object. The child class implicitly inherits all the attributes and methods of the base class and in addition can \n",
