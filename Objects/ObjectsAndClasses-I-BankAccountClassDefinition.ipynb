    "<h3>Objects And Classes - I - Class Definition</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture will discuss the most important construct in object oriented programming - `classes`.  A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects. Each object is described by its attributes and has behavior associated with it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior is captured through the `methods` of an object while the `attributes` describe different properties of the object. While all objects of a class will have the same set of attributes and methods, the values of the attributes will likely be different for each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object of a class is an `instance` of a class and hence the attributes asscociated with an object are also called `instance variables`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "<font color='blue'>Class:</font> Dog \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>Attributes:</font>  name, age, breed, color  \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>Methods:</font> bark, eat, sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='blue'>Object:</font> dog object\n",

Methods which operate on an instance of a class are also called `instance` methods.\n",
